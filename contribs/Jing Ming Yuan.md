-Wrote first tester for Area 3 (commit b43f7ba00e5907d97440ec889388b0305ccb5ebf) and fixed it later on to keep up with changes.

-Fixed bugs here and there

-Participated in discussions in all areas. For instance, in Issue #3 discussed the best way to implement Strategy filters, Singleton menu, and Flyweight items.
