## Area 1
* [Reviewer](https://gitlab.cs.mcgill.ca/mnassif/303a7t9/-/issues/5#note_43424): Reviewed teammate's implementation of Area1 and spotted issues such as poor code re-usage, the lack of polymorphism in one type of solution and limited separation of concerns. Further suggested solutions to these problems that features the creation of a FilterLibrary/FilteringUtils.java file (which became part of our current implementation) and a sorter interface. Note the review is posted under the Area4 thread but this in fact applies mostly to Area1. It was only posted here because it naturally follows from teammate's discussions there.

## Area 3
* [Implementer](d714fc688303ade9bb71e2963ababcd7a0851d14): Main implementer for both the sketch and the current solution for Area3 by introducing the Observer pattern. In particular, created the Observer.java interface and MenuPanel.java class to establish the push dataflow from Menu to the GUI panels. Further opened a [discussion thread and provided a class diagram](https://gitlab.cs.mcgill.ca/mnassif/303a7t9/-/issues/2) to introduce the observer pattern to teammates.

## Area 4
* [Tester](1ca19bae19ab5d1f5cb554c238ea3463495a15ff)+also the [proceeding commit](f12d0fce2821bfe2a28d284d1b0780a125fc9699): Authored the main part of the JUnit test for Area4 in order to verify the proper functioning of the different menu configurations.
